                    Israel’s psychological operation in Gaza
                </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>The 2014 Gaza War, also known as Operation Protective Edge ,and Battle of the Withered Grain was a military operation launched by Israel on 8 July 2014 in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian territory that has been governed by Hamas since 2007. Following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank by Hamas-affiliated Palestinian militants, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation Brother's Keeper, in which some 350 Palestinians, including nearly all of the active Hamas militants in the West Bank, were arrested.Hamas subsequently fired a greater number of rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip, triggering a seven-week-long conflict between the two sides. It was one of the deadliest outbreaks of open conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in decades. The combination of Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes resulted in over two thousand deaths, the vast majority of which were Gazan Palestinians. <br><br>

                        The Israeli military operation aimed to stop rocket fire into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Conversely, Hamas' attacks aimed to bring international pressure onto Israel with the strategic goal of forcing the latter to lift the Israeli–Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip; among its other goals were to end Israel's military offensive, obtain a third party to monitor and guarantee compliance with a ceasefire, release Palestinian political prisoners and overcome its isolation. According to the BBC, Israel launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip in retaliation to the rocket attacks by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and other Palestinian militant groups. <br> <br></p>

                    <p> <br> Around 65,000 Palestinians are still displaced since Israel waged a war on the Gaza Strip in 2014, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. <br><br>

                        "When the Israeli offensive stopped in 2014, [a total of] 100,000 Gazans were not able to return to their homes, which were completely demolished,” the agency said. <br><br>
                        
                        “Until this day, two years after the offensive, 65,000 of them remain displaced," adding that "only 35 percent of people have managed to return to their homes." <br><br>
                        
                        According to the Gaza-based agency, the main reasons obstructing the reconstruction process were a lack of "finance and materials due to the ongoing blockade imposed by Israel, and difficulty in coordination with the Palestinian side." <br><br>
                        
                        On July 7, 2014, Israel launched the Operation Protective Edge against the Gaza Strip, which ended on Aug. 26, 2014. <br><br>
                        
                        The operation led to the killing of 2,147 Palestinians, among them 578 children, 489 women and 102 elderly persons. <br><br>
                        
                        According to statistics compiled by the agency, in coordination with the United Nations Development Program, the number of housing units totally destroyed reached 12,000, with the number of partially destroyed homes reaching 160,000. <br><br>
                        
                        According to United Nations statements, the agency’s shelters have managed to absorb 300,000 refugees in more than 91 schools and facilities belonging to the UN organization.</p>

                    <p>
                        International reactions to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict came from many countries and international organizations around the world. <br><br>

Canada was supportive of Israel and critical of Hamas. The BRICS countries called for restraint on both sides and a return to peace talks based on the Arab Peace Initiative. The European Union condemned the violations of the laws of war by both sides, while stressing the "unsustainable nature of the status quo", and calling for a settlement based on the two-state solution. The Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League, and most Latin American countries were critical of Israel, with some countries in the latter group withdrawing their ambassadors from Israel in protest. South Africa called for restraint by both sides and an end to "collective punishment of Palestinians". <br><br>

There were many pro-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrations worldwide, including inside Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to OCHA, 23 Palestinians were killed and 2,218 were wounded by the IDF (38% of the latter by live fire) during these demonstrations. <br><br>

Concerns were raised regarding rising anti-Semitism and related violencedeemed related to the conflict. <br><br>

                <h2>Gaza</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>On 6 August 2014, thousands of Palestinians rallied in Gaza in support of Hamas, demanding an end to the blockade of Gaza. After the 26 August ceasefire, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research conducted a poll in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip: 79% of respondents said that Hamas had won the war and 61% said that they would pick Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh as the Palestinian president, up from 41% before the war. <br><br>

                        According to The Washington Post, a percentage of Gazans held Hamas accountable for the humanitarian crisis and wanted the militants to stop firing rockets from their neighborhoods to avoid Israeli reaction. Some of the Gazans have attempted to protest against Hamas, which routinely accuses protesters of being Israeli spies and has killed more than 50 such protesters. Around 6 August, Palestinian protesters reportedly attacked and beat up Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri because they blamed Hamas for inciting Operation Protective Edge. <br><br>
                        
                        An unknown number of Palestinians, estimated in the hundreds or thousands, tried to flee to Europe due to the conflict. The Palestinian rights group Adamir collected the names of 400 missing persons. In what was described by International Organization for Migration as the "worst shipwreck in years", a boat carrying refugees was rammed by smugglers and capsized off the coast of Malta, resulting in the deaths of about 400 people. According to interviews with survivors, they paid smugglers between $2,000–$5,000 or used legal travel permits, to get to Egypt. One refugee who died had considered the boat to be rickety but told his father "I have no life in Gaza anyway".</p>
