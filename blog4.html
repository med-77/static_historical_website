                    <p>The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was established in 1964 and has been the embodiment of the Palestinian national movement. It is a broad national front, or an umbrella organization, comprised of numerous organizations of the resistance movement, political parties, popular organizations, and independent personalities and figures from all sectors of life. The Arab Summit in 1974 recognized the PLO as the “sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people” and since then the PLO has represented Palestine at the United Nations, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM), the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and in many other fora. In addition to its broad national and political goals, the PLO has dealt with numerous tasks with regard to the life of the Palestinian people in their main communities and throughout the world through the establishment of several institutions in such realms as health, education and social services. As such, the PLO is more than a national liberation movement striving to achieve the national goals of the Palestinian people, including the independence of the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital. <br> </p>

                    <p>A look at the challenges encountered as Palestinians sought to wrest control of their own destiny from Arab regimes. <br><br>
                        In the first episode of this six-part series, Al Jazeera looks at the challenges encountered as Palestinians sought to wrest control of their own destiny from Arab regimes and create an independent Palestinian organisation. <br><br>
                        
                        In 1947, the UN General Assembly decided to partition Palestine into two states: one Arab, the other Jewish.<br><br>

                        The British Mandate ended at midnight, and on May 15, the Israeli state came into being.</p>

                    Impact of PLO establishment
                </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        The partition plan was rejected by the Palestinians and neighbouring Arab states and in early 1948, open conflict erupted between Jews and Palestinians. <br><br>

Following the withdrawal of the last British troops in May 1948, Jewish leaders proclaimed the establishment of the state of Israel. <br><br>

On the very next day, five Arab countries – Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq – immediately declared war. <br><br>

The Arab armies were defeated. The newly-declared state of Israel seized control of most of Palestine, with the exception of Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. <br><br>

By 1949, close to 750,000 Palestinians had become refugees. <br><br>

Sixteen years later, in 1964, believing that armed struggle was the only way to win back their homeland, the PLO was founded. <br><br>

Masters of Their Own Destiny tells the story of these years and features interviews with key players in the Palestinian struggle for statehood, including Yasser Arafat, the late PLO leader. <br><br>

                    <p>Investigating the 1988 killing of key Palestinian figure Khalil al-Wazir, or Abu Jihad, by Israeli commandos in Tunisia. <br><br>
                        Khalil al-Wazir, better known in the Arab world as Abu Jihad, was a key figure in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), helping found Fatah in the late 1950s. For years, he was the effective deputy to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. <br><br>
                        He was shot dead by Israeli agents in an audacious commando raid in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, in 1988. Israel denied responsibility for nearly 25 years until 2012, when an Israeli newspaper published an interview with Israeli soldier Nahum Lev, who killed Abu Jihad, eventually revealing the truth. <br><br></p>
