                    Operation Al-Aqsa Flood was provoked by Israeli aggression and occupation
                </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>A series of coordinated armed incursions, led by the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, from the Gaza Strip into the Gaza envelope of neighbouring Israeli territory, commenced on 7 October 2023, a Sabbath day and date of several Jewish holidays. The attacks initiated the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, almost exactly 50 years after the Yom Kippur War began on 6 October 1973. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups named the attacks Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, while they are referred to in Israel as Black Saturday, or the Simchat Torah Massacre, and internationally as the 7 October attack. <br><br>

                        The attacks began in the early morning with a rocket barrage of at least 3,000 rockets launched against Israel and vehicle-transported and powered paraglider incursions into its territory. Hamas fighters breached the Gaza–Israel barrier, killing civilians in neighboring Israeli communities and attacking Israeli military bases. In a single day, 859 Israeli civilians and at least 350 Israeli soldiers and policemen were killed in nearby towns, kibbutzim, military bases and at a music festival near Re'im. Around 250 Israeli civilians and soldiers were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, of which the number of kidnapped children is about 30. <br><br>
                        
                        At least 44 nations denounced the attack as terrorism, while many Arab and Muslim countries blamed the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories as the root cause of the attack. The day is considered the bloodiest in Israel's history and the deadliest for Jews since the Holocaust. </p>

                    <p> <br> A picture of Odeh standing alone in front of a tank, with a stone in his hand and arm bent back to throw it, was taken by a photojournalist from the American non-profit Associated Press on 29 October 2000. Ten days later, on 8 November, Odeh was again throwing stones at Karni when he was shot in the neck by an Israeli soldier. The boy and the image subsequently assumed iconic status within Palestinian movement as a symbol of their opposition to the Israeli occupation.</p>

                    <p><br>Israeli attack hits ambulance at gate of al-Shifa Hospital, killing 15 people and injuring 16 others, Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says.
                        <br>Israel has confirmed it bombed an ambulance in Gaza, alleging that Hamas was using the vehicle – a claim rejected by Health Ministry spokesman.
                        <br>In a separate attack, children are among at least 14 Palestinians killed while escaping south along Gaza’s coastal road, according to officials.
                        <br>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says Israel is pursuing goal it cannot achieve, as he delivers his first public speech since start of the war.
                        <br>At least nine Palestinians killed in overnight Israeli raids across occupied West Bank, including five in Jenin.
                        <br>At least 9,227 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel.</p>

                    World condemns Israel’s war on Gaza as it marches for Palestine

                    <img src="images/flood3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Demonstrators rallied across the world to show their solidarity with Palestinians and to protest against the Israeli army’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip on World Human Rights Day. <br><br>

                        Protests were held on Sunday in Istanbul, Copenhagen, The Hague, Tunis, Melbourne, Tokyo, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Karachi, Sanaa, Rabat and elsewhere. <br><br>
                        
                        Every year on December 10, the international community observes Human Rights Day to commemorate the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. <br><br>
                        
                        A large number of people gathered in Istanbul on Sunday to protest against the Israeli attacks on Gaza.
                        
                        Human rights organisations backed the demonstration. Speakers slammed Israel’s military for human rights violations, including the destruction of Gaza’s basic infrastructure, which they said leaves 500,000 people vulnerable due to a lack of water and food. <br><br>
                        
                        The rally gathered in Beyazit Square carrying pro-Palestine banners. After marching to the Hagia Sophia Mosque, the Quran was read, followed by prayers. <br><br>
                        
                        Thousands also gathered in Western Balkan capitals to show their support for Palestine. <br><br>
                        
                        In the Serbian capital Belgrade, Palestinian and Serbian flags were flown at a demonstration in front of the main government building. Banners and placards demanded a “Ceasefire Now” and for Israel to “End the Genocide in Palestine”, while a chant of “Free Palestine” went up. <br><br>
                        
                        According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health spokesperson, about 18,000 Palestinians have been killed and 49,500 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7. <br><br>
                        
                        Israel’s relentless bombardment continues, along with ground operations that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from the northern and central areas to the increasingly overcrowded south.

                <h2>Palestinians call for global strike on December 11 to demand Gaza ceasefire</h2>
                <article>

                    <p>Palestinian activists and grassroots organisations have called for a global strike on Monday to demand an immediate ceasefire as Israel continues its aggression on Gaza. <br><br>

                        The call for the strike has been given by the National and Islamic Forces, a coalition of major Palestinian factions, to Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and supporters across the world to participate in a strike that would include “all aspects of public life” in a show of solidarity amid relentless Israeli attacks. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/flood4.webp" alt="">
                    <p> <br><br>“We expect the entire globe to join the strike, which comes in the context of a broad international movement involving influential figures. This movement stands against the open genocide in Gaza, the ethnic cleansing and the colonial settlement in the West Bank,” said a statement released by the coalition. 

                        “The strike also opposes attempts to undermine the just national cause of the Palestinian people,” it said.</p>
